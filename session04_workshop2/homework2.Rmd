# Climate change and temperature anomalies

If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined
Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the
Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of
temperature anomalies can be found
here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base,
period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between
1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and
`na`.

1.  The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in
    Row 2, so we need to skip one row.
2.  `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the
    spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see
    that missing data is coded as "\*\*\*". It is best to specify this
    here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric
    data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather`
in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the
top-right), go to `Tools` \> `Global Options` \> `Pane Layout` and tick
the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and
the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of
temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide
format.

You have two objectives in this section:

1.  Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather`
    dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this
    assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

2.  Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use
    `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as
    `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as
    `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.

```{r tidyweather}

```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for

1.  year,
2.  month, and
3.  delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a
trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called
`date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot
chronologically.

> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument,
> which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the
> document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe
> `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your
> document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all
> chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**

```{r scatter_plot, eval=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months?
Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month,
again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels;
that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or
abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`.

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

#Your code goes here...

```

It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to
study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as
1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes
a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980.
The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups
data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010
and 2011-present.

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the
`mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains
information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign
the different periods using `case_when()`.

```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the
`Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot
to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by
the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to
`interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}



```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might
be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using
`group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display
the result.

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(......) 

#plotting the data:


  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method

  
  #change theme to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
                        


```

## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their
website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php)
that

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast
> amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that
> much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge
> the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual
delta since 2011. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has
already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we
are only interested in what is happening between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```

# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r, eda_on_weight}

```

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let’s create a new variable in the dataframe `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus` , which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. You may also want to calculate the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days. RUse the `count()` function and see if you get the same results as `group_by()... summarise()`

  
```{r, mutate_and_count}



```
Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?

  
Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}

```

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean, SD, etc. weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.


```{r, ci_using_formulas}

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least 3 times a week and those who don’t. You  m ay want to remove any NAs you have in `physical_3plus`, as the t.test wont'run with more than 2 categories.


```{r, t_test_using_R}

t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```



# Challenge 1: Share of renewable energy production in the world

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has a a very interesting
dataset on the adoption of about 200 technologies in more than 150
countries since 1800. This is the[Cross-country Historical Adoption of
Technology (CHAT) dataset](https://www.nber.org/research/data/cross-country-historical-adoption-technology).

The following is a description of the variables

| **variable** | **class** | **description**                |
|--------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| variable     | character | Variable name                  |
| label        | character | Label for variable             |
| iso3c        | character | Country code                   |
| year         | double    | Year                           |
| group        | character | Group (consumption/production) |
| category     | character | Category                       |
| value        | double    | Value (related to label)       |

```{r,load_technology_data}

technology <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-19/technology.csv')

#get all technologies
labels <- technology %>% 
  distinct(variable, label)

# Get country names using 'countrycode' package
technology <- technology %>% 
  filter(iso3c != "XCD") %>% 
  mutate(iso3c = recode(iso3c, "ROM" = "ROU"),
         country = countrycode(iso3c, origin = "iso3c", destination = "country.name"),
         country = case_when(
           iso3c == "ANT" ~ "Netherlands Antilles",
           iso3c == "CSK" ~ "Czechoslovakia",
           iso3c == "XKX" ~ "Kosovo",
           TRUE           ~ country))

#make smaller dataframe on energy
energy <- technology %>% 
  filter(category == "Energy")

# download CO2 per capita from World Bank using {wbstats} package
# https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC
co2_percap <- wb_data(country = "countries_only", 
                      indicator = "EN.ATM.CO2E.PC", 
                      start_date = 1970, 
                      end_date = 2022,
                      return_wide=FALSE) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value)) %>% 
  #drop unwanted variables
  select(-c(unit, obs_status, footnote, last_updated))

# get a list of countries and their characteristics
# we just want to get the region a country is in and its income level
countries <-  wb_cachelist$countries %>% 
  select(iso3c,region,income_level)

```

This is a very rich data set, not just for energy and CO2 data, but for many other technologies. In our case, we just need to produce a couple of graphs-- at this stage, the emphasis is on data manipulation, rather than making the graphs gorgeous.

First, produce a graph with the countries with the highest and lowest % contribution of renewables in energy production. This is made up of `elec_hydro`, `elec_solar`, `elec_wind`, and `elec_renew_other`. You may want to use the *patchwork* package to assemble the two charts next to each other.
 
```{r min-max_renewables, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "renewables.png"), error = FALSE)
```
Second, you can produce an animation to explore the relationship between CO2 per capita emissions and the deployment of renewables. As the % of energy generated by renewables goes up, do CO2 per capita emissions seem to go down?

 
```{r animation, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "animation.gif"), error = FALSE)
```

To create this animation is actually straight-forward. You manipulate your date, and the create the graph in the normal ggplot way. the only `gganimate` layers you need to add to your graphs are

```
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', 
       x = '% renewables', 
       y = 'CO2 per cap') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')
```

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all
components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same
type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the
variables being analyzed.

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes.
Easy to follow (both the code and the output).

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly
and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both
self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used
tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled.
Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled
clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret
the output.
